/* 
This ðŸ‘‡ isn't normally something you'd need to do. Instead, you'd 
set up Firebase security rules so only the currently logged-in user 
could edit their vans.

https://firebase.google.com/docs/rules

I'm just leaving this here for educational purposes, as it took
me a while to find the `documentId()` function that allows you
to use a where() filter on a document's ID property. (Since normally
it only looks at the data() properties of the document, meaning you
can't do `where("id", "==", id))`

It also shows how you can chain together multiple `where` filter calls
